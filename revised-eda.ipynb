    "Vehicle insurance fraud is a major issue that results in significant financial losses for insurance companies and undermines trust in the insurance system. Fraudulent claims can range from staged accidents to exaggerated personal injury claims, complicating the claims process and driving up costs (Punith, 2021). Our key question is: <span>How can vehicle and policy data be leveraged to accurately detect and prevent fraudulent insurance claims?</span> Our primary goal is to develop a reliable predictive model that identifies fraudulent claims using historical data. This model aims to help insurance companies reduce financial losses, streamline claims processing, and ensure fair premium pricing for customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach to detecting and preventing vehicle insurance claim fraud involves several key steps, which will be meticulously documented and reviewed to ensure technical soundness and business viability:\n",
    "* **Data Integrity:** Examine the data structure, check for missing values, and convert data types appropriately. This step ensures the foundation of our dataset is solid and ready for analysis.\n",
    "* **Encoding and Scaling:** Convert categorical variables into numerical formats using one-hot encoding and standardize numerical features. This step is crucial for preparing the data for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the target variable distribution, visualize numerical and categorical features, and perform correlation analysis. This provides insights into the data and helps identify patterns.\n",
    "* **Feature Selection:** Set a correlation threshold, use a Random Forest classifier to determine feature importance, and select the most predictive features. This step helps in identifying the most relevant features for our model.\n",
    "* **Feature Engineering:**  Enhance the dataset with interaction and polynomial features. This can potentially improve the model's ability to detect complex patterns indicative of fraud.\n",
    "* **Modeling and Evaluation:** \n",
    "  1. Baseline Models: Train baseline models and evaluate their performance to establish a benchmark.\n",
    "  2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the models through hyperparameter tuning to enhance performance.\n",
    "  3. Model Selection: Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.\n",
    "  4. Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness.\n",
    "  5. Final Model Training: Train the final model with selected features and prepare it for deployment.<br><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Deployment:** Deploy the model in a production environment and continuously monitor its performance. This step ensures the model is operational and provides real-time fraud detection.\n",
    "* **Discussion and Conclusion:** Provide actionable recommendations based on the model's findings. Discuss business, ethical, and regulatory risks associated with the deployment and use of the model."

Key features analyzed include WeekOfMonth, WeekOfMonthClaimed, Age, PolicyNumber, RepNumber, Deductible, and DriverRating. The distribution of WeekOfMonth and WeekOfMonthClaimed is even across different weeks, showing no clear distinction between fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims. The age distribution is right-skewed, with most claimants between 20 and 50 years old, but no strong separation based on age is observed. PolicyNumber appears uniformly distributed, indicating no particular sequence pattern that differentiates fraudulent claims, while RepNumber shows a varied distribution, which could be further explored for potential bias. The deductible amounts are concentrated at specific values, with no clear separation for fraudulent claims, and DriverRating is evenly distributed across its range, again showing no distinct separation for fraudulent claims.</span>\n",
